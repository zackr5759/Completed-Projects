# Completed-Projects
This Repo contains all of the completed projects that I have gone back to and touched up to display my journey in learning to code. Most are from curriculum from the Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC) or Sonoma State University (SSU).

Battle Arena:
A c++ program from my second semester ever of coding. It was an exercise in the usage of classes and inheritance and plays out like a game. It's usage is self explanatory with prompts after compiling and running the executable.

Chase game:
An extremely simple javascript game made with the Phaser engine from my time in game development at the SRJC. The controls are just the arrow keys and you try to avoid touching the little monsters that spawn around your character and run at you.

JSON Data Analysis:
A c++ program from my Data Structures class at SSU. Reads through the two given JSON files with fake student data in them and creates a map with all the student GPA's as the value and their ID's as the key to the map. This was an exercise in time complexity and using the right data structures as both lists had many thousands of students and we had to determine which students were in both semesters and create a matrix representing student's grade changes that went to both semesters. 

Word Game:
A javascript word forming game written with partner William Armstrong for game development at SSU. The controls are 1-5 to select a letter tile when it passes over the respective bubble, 0 to delete a tile out of your current bank, and the enter key to attempt to complete a word. This was made using open source assets.
